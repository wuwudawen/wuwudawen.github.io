I am Dawen Wu (吴达文), a Ph.D. candidate in [Université Paris-Saclay](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/), CNRS, CentraleSupélec, [Laboratory of
Signals and Systems](https://l2s.centralesupelec.fr/en/) supervised by Prof. [Abdel Lisser](https://l2s.centralesupelec.fr/u/lisser-abdel/). Before that, I received my Master’s degree in computer science from [Peking University](https://english.pku.edu.cn/). 

My academic background is in applied mathematics, with research interests encompassing optimization, game theory, and machine learning.

My Ph.D. research is aimed at leveraging machine learning models to tackle various challenging optimization problems. 
It can be divided into two main parts: 
* (1) employing CNN-based models to predict Nash equilibria in game theory, as explored in publications 1, 3, and 4; 
* (2) utilizing Physics-Informed Neural Networks to address constrained optimization problems, including but not limited to convex optimization, which is the focus of publications 2 and 5.

## Education
* **B.S.** in School of Economics and Management, Civil Aviation University of China, 2013-2017.
* **M.S.** in Computer Science, Peking University, 2017-2020.  
            Advisor: Prof. [Zhong Chen](https://infosec.pku.edu.cn/zsxx/bszs/index.htm).   
            Selected coures: 1) Convex optimization, 2) Machine learning, 3) Reinforcement learning    
* **Ph.D.** Candidate in Applied Mathematics, Université Paris-Saclay, 2020-2023 (Expected to graduate in Oct. 2023).  
            Advisor: Prof. [Abdel Lisser](https://l2s.centralesupelec.fr/u/lisser-abdel/).  
            Selected coures: 1) [Advanced continuous optimization](https://who.rocq.inria.fr/Jean-Charles.Gilbert/ipp/optim.html), 2) [Optimization and statistical learning](https://www.di.ens.fr/~fbach/orsay2021.html), 3) Stability of nonlinear systems.
