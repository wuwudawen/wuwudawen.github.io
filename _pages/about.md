I am Dawen Wu (吴达文), a Ph.D. candidate in Université Paris-Saclay, CNRS, CentraleSupélec, Laboratoire des signaux et systèmes supervised by Prof. [Abdel Lisser](https://l2s.centralesupelec.fr/u/lisser-abdel/). Before that, I received my Master’s degree in computer science from Peking University. 

My research interests lie in optimization, machine learning, and game theory, with a focus on using deep learning to solve complex optimization problems. 
My PhD work involved utilizing neural networks for finding Nash equilibria in game theory and solving nonlinear constrained optimization problems.
