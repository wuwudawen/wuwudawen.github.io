I am Dawen Wu (吴达文), a Ph.D. candidate in [Université Paris-Saclay](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/), CNRS, CentraleSupélec, [Laboratory of
Signals and Systems](https://l2s.centralesupelec.fr/en/) supervised by Prof. [Abdel Lisser](https://l2s.centralesupelec.fr/u/lisser-abdel/). Before that, I received my Master’s degree in computer science from [Peking University](https://english.pku.edu.cn/). 

My research interests focus on optimization, machine learning, and game theory. 

My PhD research focused on two main areas: (1) developing CNN-based models to predict Nash equilibria in game theory, and (2) applying Physics-Informed Neural Networks to solve challenging nonlinear constrained optimization problems. My publications 1, 3, 4 focus on the first area, while publications 2 and 5 focus on the second.
